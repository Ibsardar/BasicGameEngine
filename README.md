# Basic LÃ–VE2D Game Engine
###### By: *Ibrahim Sardar*

A simple game engine that handles translation, rotation, scaling, velocity, acceleration, all of which is encapsulated into one Sprite class.

( Class is inherited from the SECL class "full.lua" : https://github.com/bartbes/love-misc-libs/blob/master/SECL/full.lua )

## It Comes With A Fish Game!

A feeding frenzy type fish game is included to give a brief demo of the engine. "Blob.lua" (should have been called 'Fish.lua') presents how to inherrit from the Sprite Class. It also shows which functions to override for maximum customizability and how to handle events and features of the sort using "Sprite.lua".

## How?

copy all files/folders and put them somewhere on your pc. Then double click Game.exe to play the demo fish game.

## Docs?

Documentation and instructions are in the 'info' folder.

**Note:** documentation is ***extremely minimal*** at the moment (does not show return values). I will complete it in the near future.
