mini game instructions:
---------------------------------|   By: Ibrahim Sardar

=== Purpose ===
To demonstrate Game Loop functions: load, update, & draw
To demonstrate frame rate (40fps), 2D surface, blit order
To demonstrate usage of Sprite class with collisions and bounds
To demonstrate translation, rotation, and scaling

=== Goal ===
Eat the smaller fish to increase your size, speed, and acceleration.
Avoid larger fish.
Game restarts on collision with larger fish.

=== Controls ===
Q - quit
Space - shoot mini fish (shrinks enemy fishes)
Right/Left Arrow Keys - turn right/left
Up/Down Arrow Keys - Accelerate forward/backward

=== FILES (by me) ===

blob.lua
sprite.lua
conf.lua
blob.png   (would rather name it "fish.png")
